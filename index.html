        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="images/IMG_0719.JPG" alt="Baby picture of me">

        <p>I am a first year Graphic Designer at Algonquin College and am eager to get into the industry and start working. I'm really open to all oppurtunites that come my way and intersted in exploring everything. Graphic Design was never something I thought I would get into when I was younger but as I started to explore options this program jumped out at me.</p>

        <p>In my free time I always enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. I like country, hip hop, r&b, and rock&roll and more. I love spending time with my family and friends when I get the chance to. </p>
