            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img src="images/IMG_0719.JPG" alt="Baby picture of me">

            <p>I am a first year Graphic Designer at Algonquin College and i'm eager to get into the industry and start working. I'm really open to all oppurtunites that come my way and am intersted in exploring different pathways. Graphic Design was never something I thought I would get into when I was younger but as I started exploring the options this program jumped out at me, and i'm glad it did!</p>

            <p>In my free time I always enjoy listening to music and going to concerts. I like country, hip hop, r&b, rock&roll and more. I'm looking forward to Bluesfest 2024! I also love just spending time with my family and friends when I get the chance to. </p>
